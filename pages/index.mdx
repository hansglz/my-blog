_**Home is behind, the world ahead.**_

<h2>Who am I</h2>

I'm Hans, a full-stack software engineer from [eBay](https://tech.ebayinc.com/). I write about my life and work mainly in Chinese, but sometimes I also write articles in English. I also write about my hobbies, which include reading, writing, and thoughts after reading novels or watching movies.

Know more about my past experience from my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15mVZ3HCkXHhgpgla8oJqCjK_B0ywJdUH/view?usp=sharing).

Thoughts and discussions are always welcomed.
