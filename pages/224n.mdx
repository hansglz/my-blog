### Overview

<blockquote cite="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">
  Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial part of artificial intelligence, one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual assistants, etc. This course is designed to introduce you to deep learning for NLP and will cover a broad range of topics fundamental to NLP such as word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks as well as very recent models involving a memory component and attention. The course will end with some pointers to very current research including very large-scale models.
